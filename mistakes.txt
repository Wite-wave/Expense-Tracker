So now the total variable has an issue.
I want to get the total but the only other
solution i found was to save the price in
a list and then use it's sum a the value for
total. The problem with this is that it will
just adds up everything over and over
again. Like for example if i have just
one (1) price of 100 it will continue
to add this value onto itself even if add
another item or not. Like the first time it will give
100 the second 200 the third 300...and so on.
I dumped that issue and instead used another which also
does not work.
